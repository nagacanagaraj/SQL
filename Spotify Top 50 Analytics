--For this project I used Spotify Top 50 data from Kaggle and created a table to input the data into.

-- Creating the table.
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

--From here I inserted the CSV file into the table. Next I used SQL to explore the data.

--I selected all the data in the table to visualize the set.
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--First I determined the Top 10 most danceable tracks from the set.
SELECT track_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;

--Then I determined the Top 5 most featured artists in the set.
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) DESC
LIMIT 5;

--Then I determined the TOP 10 most popular tracks from the set.
SELECT track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Lastly, I calculated the average popularity for the artists in the data.
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, I labeled them as a â€œTop Star".
WITH popularity_avg_CTE AS (SELECT spotifydata.artist_name, AVG(spotifydata.popularity) AS avg_popularity FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY spotifydata.artist_name)
SELECT artist_name, avg_popularity, 'TOP STAR' AS tag  FROM popularity_avg_CTE
WHERE avg_popularity >= 90;
